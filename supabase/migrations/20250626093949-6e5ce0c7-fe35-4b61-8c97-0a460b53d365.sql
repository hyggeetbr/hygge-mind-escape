  'On Self-Knowledge',
  'Without knowing yourself, do what you will, there cannot be the state of meditation. I mean by self-knowledge, knowing every thought, every mood, every word, every feeling; knowing the activity of your mind—not knowing the Supreme Self, the big Self; there is no such thing; the Higher Self, the Atman, is still within the field of thought.

Self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation—not the knowledge of the Supreme Self, but the knowledge of the little self, the knowledge of your daily activities, your daily thoughts and desires and pleasures and ambitions. That is where one must begin, and most of us do not want to begin there. We want to soar in the skies; we want to reach the heights of spiritual ecstasy without first understanding ourselves, the way we behave, the way we talk, the way we think.

Without understanding yourself, without knowing how your mind works, how your thought functions, you cannot go very far. It is like a house built on sand, and all your gods, all your disciplines, all your sacrifices, will have no meaning at all.

To know yourself is to study yourself in action, which is relationship. The "me," the self, is understood only in relationship, in your relationship to property, to people, and to ideas. You cannot understand yourself in isolation. Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself. Without relationship, you are not; to be is to be related; to be related is existence.

Through self-knowledge, through being aware of the total process of yourself, the mind frees itself from its petty desires, ambitions, envies, and anxieties. Without self-knowledge, you cannot go beyond the self-projected illusions of the mind.',

  'Truth is a Pathless Land',
  'Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path.

You are accustomed to being told how far you have advanced, what spiritual status you have, and the rest of it; all that is tommyrot. No man can tell you where you are. Where you are, only you can know, and that, if you are honest with yourself, not being caught up in self-deception.

The moment you follow someone, you cease to follow Truth. I am not concerned whether you pay attention to what I say or not. I want to do a certain thing in the world and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerning myself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him from all cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor to establish new theories and new philosophies.

If an organization be created for this purpose, it becomes a crutch, a weakness, a bondage, and must cripple the individual and prevent him from growing, from establishing his uniqueness, which lies in the discovery for himself of that absolute, unconditioned Truth.

Truth is within you. Do not search for it outside of yourself, in books, in temples, in gurus. It is your own being, your own consciousness, your own heart. Look within, and you will find it.',

  'The Art of Listening',
  'There is an art to listening. To listen to someone, you must put aside your own thoughts, prejudices, opinions, comparisons, and judgments. When you are comparing what is being said with what you already know, you are not listening. When you are judging what is being said based on your beliefs and experiences, you are not listening.

True listening is giving complete attention, without resistance, without judgment, without interpretation. It is listening with all your being, with your mind, with your heart, with your whole body. It is a state of total receptivity, where the listener and the listened disappear, and only listening remains.

When you listen in this way, something extraordinary happens. You begin to hear not just the words but the meaning behind the words. You begin to hear the silence between the words. You begin to hear the unspoken, the unexpressed, the unsaid.

Most of us never listen. We are so full of our own ideas, our own problems, our own desires, that we have no space to receive something new. Our cup is already full. To listen, the cup must be empty.

When you listen to the rain, to the wind in the trees, to the birds singing, to a crying child, to a laughing friend, without naming, without judging, without comparing, without evaluating, you will find that your consciousness undergoes a tremendous change. You become more sensitive, more alert, more alive.

The art of listening is the beginning of understanding. Without understanding, there is no transformation. Without transformation, there is no freedom. Without freedom, there is no life.',

  'Freedom from the Known',
  'Freedom from the known is the beginning of wisdom. The known is your accumulated experiences, knowledge, memories, beliefs, opinions, ideas, and conclusions. All these make up your psychological past, which colors and shapes your present perception and future action.

As long as you look at life through the screen of the known, you are not seeing what is; you are seeing only what was. You are living in the past, not in the present. You are responding to the present from the background of the past, and therefore you are not responding adequately, completely, fully.

Freedom from the known means freedom from the past, freedom from memory, freedom from time. It means seeing each experience, each event, each person, each feeling afresh, as if for the first time, without the burden of the past.

This freedom does not come through effort, through discipline, through suppression, or through escape. It comes only through understanding the whole structure of the known, through seeing how the mind is conditioned by the known, and how this conditioning prevents the perception of what is.

The moment you see the truth that the known prevents the understanding of what is, the known begins to lose its hold on you. You begin to see things as they are, not as you want them to be or think they should be.

This seeing is not a gradual process. It is not that today you will be a little free from the known, tomorrow a little more, and the day after tomorrow completely free. Freedom from the known happens instantly or not at all. It is a flash of insight that transforms your whole being.',

  'Relationship as a Mirror',
  'Relationship is the mirror in which you can see yourself as you are, not as you would like to be. In relationship, your fears, your desires, your pleasures, your ambitions, your competitiveness, your loneliness, your sorrow, your entire psychological structure is exposed.

Most of us use relationship as a means of self-gratification, as a means of becoming something, as a means of escaping from ourselves. We do not see relationship as a means of self-discovery, as a means of understanding ourselves.

When you use relationship merely for convenience, for comfort, for security, for sexual pleasure, for psychological support, you are avoiding the fundamental issue, which is to understand yourself through the mirror of relationship.

To understand yourself in relationship requires extraordinary alertness, watchfulness, and honesty. You must observe your reactions in relationship without justification, without condemnation, without comparison. You must see the fact of your jealousy, your possessiveness, your dependency, your domination, your fear of losing.

Relationship is not static; it is a living movement. It changes from moment to moment. If you approach relationship with a fixed pattern, with preconceived ideas, with accumulated experiences, you will miss the living quality of relationship.

In the mirror of relationship, if you look with eyes that are not clouded by the past, you will discover your actual state of being. This discovery is the beginning of transformation.',

  'The Observer and the Observed',
  'The division between the observer and the observed is the root cause of all conflict. The observer is the past, the accumulated experiences, the knowledge, the memory. The observed is the present, the actual, the what is.

When you observe your anger, your jealousy, your fear, your desire, who is the observer? Is the observer different from the observed? Or is the observer the observed?

You say, "I am angry." In this statement, there is a division between "I" and "anger." "I" is the observer, and "anger" is the observed. But is "I" different from "anger"? Or is "I" created by thought to separate itself from "anger" in order to control it, suppress it, or get rid of it?

The fact is that the observer is the observed. The "I" that says it is angry is itself part of anger. The "I" that says it is jealous is itself part of jealousy. The "I" that says it must control desire is itself part of desire.

When you see this fact, not as an idea, not as a concept, but as an actual fact in your daily life, something extraordinary happens. The division between the observer and the observed collapses. There is only observation without the observer.

This observation without the observer is choiceless awareness. It is seeing what is without judgment, without evaluation, without interpretation. In this seeing, the what is undergoes a radical transformation.',

  'Meditation Without Method',
  'Meditation is not a method, a system, a practice that you do for a certain period each day. Meditation is a way of life. It is a state of mind that is attentive, aware, sensitive, alert from moment to moment.

Methods of meditation only condition the mind. They create a pattern, a groove, a habit. They may give you certain experiences, certain sensations, certain pleasures, but they do not lead to freedom, to truth, to understanding.

True meditation begins with self-knowledge. Without understanding yourself—your thoughts, your emotions, your reactions, your desires, your fears—meditation has no meaning. It is like decorating the walls of a prison cell while remaining a prisoner.

Meditation is the seeing of what is without trying to change what is. It is the observation of fear without resistance, of desire without judgment, of anger without condemnation. It is seeing the fact of what you are, not what you think you should be.

In this seeing, there is no division between the seer and the seen. There is only seeing. There is no experiencer separate from the experience. There is only experience. This state of non-duality is the beginning of meditation.

Meditation is not concentration. Concentration is exclusion, narrowing down of thought to a particular point. Meditation is inclusion, awareness of everything that is happening within and without, without choice, without preference.

Meditation is not an escape from the world, from your problems, from your conflicts. It is the understanding of the world, of your problems, of your conflicts, through direct perception, through choiceless awareness.',

  'The Ending of Time',
  'Time is not just chronological—the ticking of the clock, the passing of days, months, and years. There is also psychological time—the interval between desire and its fulfillment, between what is and what should be, between the actual and the ideal.

Psychological time is created by thought. Thought says, "I am this, and I will be that." "I am ignorant, and I will become knowledgeable." "I am lonely, and I will find companionship." This movement from what is to what should be is time.

As long as there is psychological time, there is conflict. Because time implies a gap, a distance, a division between what is and what should be. And in this gap, all our fears, anxieties, frustrations, disappointments, and sorrows exist.

The ending of time is the ending of thought as a movement away from what is. It is the ending of becoming, achieving, attaining. It is the ending of the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It is the ending of the search for security, certainty, and permanency.

When psychological time ends, what remains is what is. And what is is the actual, the real, the true. It is your anger, your fear, your loneliness, your pleasure, your pain as it is, without the interference of thought trying to change it, escape from it, or transcend it.

In the ending of time, there is a different dimension of existence, a different quality of being. There is the timeless, the eternal, the sacred. Not as something to be achieved in the future, but as the very nature of what is when it is seen without the screen of thought, without the burden of time.',

  'Education and the Significance of Life',
  'The function of education is not merely to prepare you to get a job, to earn a livelihood, to become a specialist, to acquire knowledge and skills. These are necessary, but they are secondary. The primary function of education is to help you understand yourself and your relationship with the world.

Most education today is the cultivation of memory, the accumulation of knowledge, and the development of skills. It is concerned with the outer, not with the inner. It is concerned with the known, not with the unknown. It is concerned with the past, not with the present or the future.

True education begins with the understanding of yourself. Without understanding yourself, without knowing how your mind works, how your thought functions, education has little meaning. You may acquire degrees, you may have a great deal of knowledge, you may be very skilled, but if you do not understand yourself, all your knowledge and skills will only lead to further confusion and conflict.

Education should help you to think, not what to think. It should help you to question, to inquire, to doubt, to find out for yourself what is true. It should not merely impart information, but awaken intelligence.

Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the essential, the what is, without distortion by desire and fear. Intelligence is not the result of education, of book knowledge, of experience. Intelligence comes into being when there is freedom from self-centered activity.

Education should prepare you not only for a career but for life. It should help you to face life with its complexities, its challenges, its sufferings, and its joys. It should help you to live a life of integrity, sensitivity, and understanding.',

  'The Flame of Attention',
  'Attention is the most precious thing you have. Where you give your attention, that is what grows in your life. If you give attention to problems, problems multiply. If you give attention to pleasure, pleasure becomes all-important. If you give attention to fear, fear dominates your life.

Most of us live in a state of inattention. We are absent-minded, distracted, lost in thoughts, daydreams, memories, and plans. We are not present to our own lives. We are not aware of what is happening within and around us.

Attention is not concentration. Concentration is focused on one point, excluding everything else. Attention is inclusive, embracing everything. Concentration is a form of resistance, a form of exclusion. Attention is a form of love, a form of total acceptance.

When you are completely attentive, there is no center as the "me" that is attending. There is only attending, only attention. In this state, the observer and the observed disappear, and only observation remains.

Attention has its own action. When you are completely attentive to your anger, your fear, your desire, without trying to change it, without trying to suppress it, without trying to transcend it, a transformation takes place naturally, effortlessly.

The flame of attention burns away all the impurities of the mind—all the conflicts, all the contradictions, all the divisions. It purifies perception. It clarifies understanding. It illuminates truth.

In the light of attention, the darkness of ignorance, confusion, and conflict cannot exist. Attention is the key to transformation, to freedom, to love, to truth. Attention is the door to the sacred, to the eternal, to the divine.',
